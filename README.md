# API

An API for Charlotte Junior Devs.

## REST interface

### Events

```
GET /events
```

#### Creating New Events
```
POST /events

{
  event: {
    category: "credit name goes here",
    user_id:  user_id,
    info:     {
      whatever: "can go here",
      etc:      "etc",
    }
  }
}

```

### Recommendations

```
GET /credibility
```

## Authentication
All requests must have an `Authorization` http header with `Bearer <your-token-here>`.


<hr>
*for development environment only*

The bearer token is a JSON Web Token and can be easily generated by running:
```sh
rake token
```

Or, pipe it directly to your clipboard:

```sh
rake token | pbcopy
```





<!-- These are steps that were helpful for me when setting up the api to run locally -->

You need to install docker-toolbox
You need to install docker-for-mac

then you need to run the following commands:

docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm web bin/setup

Once you get the above complete, you can get the api running with this command:

docker-compose up
